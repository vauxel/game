# Game

"Game" is a prototype of a game engine. It features a modified entity-component-system, intra-messaging, rendering using GLFW, model loading using Assimp, and positional and directional lighting.

## Building & Running (Linux)

Ensure that the `SOIL`, `Assimp`, and `GLFW` packages are installed on your system.

Afterwards, simply run: `make` from the base directory.

To start the program, run `./build/game` from the base directory.
